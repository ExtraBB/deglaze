## Description

Mirin is a sweet, low-alcohol rice wine used for cooking, originally from Japan but also common in Korean kitchens. It adds a mild sweetness and gloss to dishes, helps mask strong odors, and enhances umami flavors. Korean versions may be labeled as "mirim" and are used similarly to Japanese mirin.

## How to use

- In marinades for meats and fish
- Added to sauces and glazes for shine and sweetness
- Used in braises and simmered dishes
- To balance salty or savory flavors in stir-fries

## Substitutions

If mirin is unavailable, a mixture of sake (or dry white wine), a little [[sugar]], and water can be used as a substitute.

## Storage

Store mirin in a cool, dark place. Once opened, keep it tightly sealed; refrigeration can extend its shelf life.
