- **Name**: Soup soy sauce (Guk-ganjang)
- **Other Names**: 국간장
- **Type**: Condiment

## Description

Guk-ganjang is a traditional Korean soy sauce made specifically for soups and stews. It is lighter in color but saltier and more intense in flavor than regular soy sauce. Guk-ganjang is made from fermented soybeans and brine, and is essential for seasoning clear soups without darkening the broth.

## How to use

- As a seasoning for soups and stews (guk, jjigae)
- In marinades for meats and vegetables
- Added to dipping sauces for a salty, umami kick

## Substitutions

If guk-ganjang is unavailable, use regular [[soy sauce]] but reduce the quantity and adjust salt to taste. Note that the color of the broth may be darker.

## Storage

Store guk-ganjang in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for several months due to its high salt content.
