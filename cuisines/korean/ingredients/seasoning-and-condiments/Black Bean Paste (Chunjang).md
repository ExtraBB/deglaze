## Description

Chunjang is a thick, dark, and savory-sweet fermented soybean paste, commonly used in Korean-Chinese cuisine. It is made from soybeans, flour, caramel, and sometimes fermented with other grains. Chunjang is the key ingredient in jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and has a deep umami flavor with a hint of bitterness and sweetness.

## How to use

- As the main sauce for [[Black Bean Noodles (Jjajangmyeon)]]
- Stir-fried with pork and vegetables for jjajangbap
- Used in Korean-Chinese stir-fries and sauces

## Substitutions

If chunjang is unavailable, Chinese fermented black bean paste (doubanjiang) can be used, though the flavor will differ. Adding a touch of [[sugar]] can help approximate the sweetness of chunjang.

## Storage

Store chunjang in an airtight container in the refrigerator after opening. It will keep for several months due to its fermentation and salt content.
