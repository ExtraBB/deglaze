- **Name**: Fish sauce (Aekjeot)
- **Other Names**: 액젓
- **Type**: Fermented seafood / Condiment

## Description

Aekjeot is a clear, amber-colored liquid made by fermenting anchovies or other small fish with salt. It is intensely salty and rich in umami, and is a key seasoning in Korean cuisine, especially for kimchi and soups. Korean fish sauce is similar to Southeast Asian varieties but may be less sweet and more pungent.

## How to use

- As a seasoning for kimchi
- Added to soups, stews, and braises for depth
- Used in dipping sauces and marinades
- To enhance umami in stir-fries

## Substitutions

If aekjeot is unavailable, Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce can be used, though the flavor may be slightly different. Soy sauce or salt can be used in a pinch, but will lack the characteristic fishy umami.

## Storage

Store fish sauce in a cool, dark place. Refrigeration after opening is recommended for best flavor and shelf life.
