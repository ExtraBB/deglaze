## Description

Barley malt powder is made from sprouted barley grains that are dried and ground into a fine powder. It is used as an enzyme source to break down starches into sugars, especially in traditional Korean sweet rice drinks and rice cakes.

## How to use

- Essential for making sikhye (sweet rice drink)
- Used in brewing and fermenting traditional Korean beverages
- Added to rice cake batters for sweetness and texture

## Substitutions

If barley malt powder is unavailable, malted milk powder or diastatic malt powder can be used, but may alter the flavor and enzyme activity.

## Storage

Store barley malt powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Refrigeration can extend shelf life and preserve enzyme activity.
