# 🥕 Deglaze: The Open Ingredient → Component → Dish Database

Welcome to **Deglaze** — an open, collaborative database mapping the world’s ingredients to cooking components and dishes, organized by cuisine. Our mission: to create a structured, markdown-based resource that’s easy for both humans and AI to query, powering the next generation of meal planning, grocery lists, and culinary creativity.

## 🌍 What is Deglaze?

Deglaze is not a recipe collection. Instead, it’s a living, growing map of:

- **Ingredients** (e.g., tomato, gochujang, masa harina)
  ↓
- **Components** (reusable parts of recipes, e.g., “sofrito”, “kimchi base”, “tortilla dough”)
  ↓
- **Dishes** (e.g., “bibimbap”, “tacos al pastor”)

All data is stored in simple, human-readable Markdown files, organized by cuisine (Korean, Mexican, Italian, etc.), making it easy to contribute and to use with tools like Obsidian.

## 🤖 Why This Matters

By structuring culinary knowledge this way, we enable:

- **LLMs and AI tools** to generate grocery lists, meal plans, and cooking suggestions with unprecedented accuracy.
- **Chefs, home cooks, and food lovers** to explore ingredient relationships and dish structures across cultures.
- **Developers and researchers** to build smarter food apps, bots, and assistants.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Open, extensible Markdown format** — easy to read, edit, and version.
- **Cuisine-based organization** for global coverage and cultural context.
- **No recipes (yet!)** — focus is on the building blocks of cooking.
- **Designed for both humans and machines** — perfect for Obsidian, LLMs, and more.
