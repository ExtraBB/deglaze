## Description

Sugar is a sweet, crystalline substance derived primarily from sugar cane and sugar beets. It is composed mainly of sucrose and is widely used as a sweetener in foods and beverages. Sugar comes in various forms, including granulated, powdered, brown, and raw, each with distinct textures and flavors. It not only provides sweetness but also affects the texture, color, and preservation of foods.

## How to use

- As a sweetener in hot and cold beverages (e.g., coffee, tea, lemonade)
- In baking for cakes, cookies, pastries, and breads
- To balance acidity in sauces, dressings, and marinades
- For caramelizing and making candies or syrups
- As a preservative in jams, jellies, and fruit preserves

## Substitutions

If sugar is unavailable, alternatives include honey, maple syrup, agave nectar, or artificial sweeteners. Note that these substitutes may alter the flavor, texture, and moisture content of the final product.

## Storage

Store sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Properly stored, sugar has an indefinite shelf life, though it may harden if exposed to moisture.
