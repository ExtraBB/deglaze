## Description

Saeujeot is a traditional Korean condiment made from tiny shrimp that are salted and fermented. It has a strong, salty, and umami-rich flavor, and is a key ingredient in kimchi and various Korean stews and side dishes.

## How to use

- As a seasoning for kimchi
- Added to soups and stews for depth
- Used in dipping sauces for pork dishes
- To enhance umami in stir-fries

## Substitutions

If saeujeot is unavailable, Thai shrimp paste or fish sauce can be used, though the flavor will differ. For a vegetarian option, use [[soy sauce]] or miso paste.

## Storage

Store saeujeot in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for several months due to its high salt content and fermentation.
