- **Name**: Sea salt
- **Other Names**: 바다소금
- **Type**: Seasoning

## Description

Sea salt is produced by evaporating seawater and contains various minerals that give it a distinct flavor and texture. Korean sea salt is often used in kimchi-making and for seasoning a wide range of dishes. It is less processed than table salt and may have a coarser texture.

## How to use

- For seasoning vegetables, meats, and seafood
- In kimchi and other fermented foods
- As a finishing salt
- In brines and pickling solutions

## Substitutions

If sea salt is unavailable, [[kosher salt]] or table salt can be used, but adjust quantities as table salt is denser and saltier by volume.

## Storage

Store sea salt in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping.
