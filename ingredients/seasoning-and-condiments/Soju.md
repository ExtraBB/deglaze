## Description

Soju is a clear, distilled alcoholic beverage native to Korea, typically made from rice, wheat, or barley. It has a mild, slightly sweet flavor and a relatively low alcohol content compared to other spirits. In cooking, soju is used to tenderize meat, remove odors, and add subtle flavor to dishes.

## How to use

- As a beverage, served neat or in cocktails
- Used in marinades for meats to tenderize and remove odors
- Added to stews and braises for depth
- Used in seafood dishes to reduce fishy smells

## Substitutions

If soju is unavailable, vodka or sake can be used in cooking, though the flavor will differ. For non-alcoholic purposes, water or broth can be substituted, but will not provide the same effect.

## Storage

Store soju in a cool, dark place. Once opened, it can be kept at room temperature or refrigerated.
