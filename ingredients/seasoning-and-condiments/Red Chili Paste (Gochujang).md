Gochujang is a savory, sweet, and spicy fermented Korean condiment made from red chili powder, glutinous rice, fermented soybeans, and salt.

Gochujang is a staple in Korean cuisine, used to add complexity and depth to a wide variety of dishes.

## How to use

- As a base for sauces and marinades (e.g., for bulgogi, bibimbap, tteokbokki)
- Mixed into soups and stews for added heat and umami
- Stirred into dipping sauces for dumplings or vegetables
- Spread on sandwiches or burgers for a spicy kick

## Substitutions

If gochujang is unavailable, a mixture of miso paste, chili paste, and a touch of [[sugar]] can approximate its flavor, though the result will lack the unique fermentation notes.

## Storage

Store gochujang in an airtight container in the refrigerator after opening. It will keep for several months due to its high salt content and fermentation.
