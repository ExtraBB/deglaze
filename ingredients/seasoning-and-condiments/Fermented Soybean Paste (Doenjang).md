- **Name**: Fermented soybean paste (Doenjang)
- **Other Names**: 된장
- **Type**: Condiment

## Description

Doenjang is a traditional Korean fermented soybean paste with a rich, salty, and earthy flavor. Made by fermenting soybeans and brine, it is a staple in Korean cooking, similar to Japanese miso but chunkier and more pungent. Doenjang is packed with umami and is used to add depth to soups, stews, and sauces.

## How to use

- As a base for soups and stews (e.g., doenjang-jjigae)
- In dipping sauces for vegetables and grilled meats
- Mixed into marinades for added umami
- Added to stir-fries and braises

## Substitutions

If doenjang is unavailable, Japanese miso paste can be used as a substitute, though it is milder and less robust. Adjust salt and flavor to taste.

## Storage

Store doenjang in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for several months, and its flavor may deepen over time due to continued fermentation.
