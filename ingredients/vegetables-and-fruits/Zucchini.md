## Description

Zucchini is a tender, mild-flavored summer squash with smooth, dark green or yellow skin and pale, juicy flesh. It is low in calories and high in water content, making it a versatile ingredient in many cuisines. Zucchini can be eaten raw or cooked, and its subtle flavor allows it to absorb seasonings and complement a wide range of dishes.

## How to use

- Sliced and sautéed as a side dish or stir-fry ingredient
- Grilled or roasted for salads and antipasti
- Spiralized into "zoodles" as a pasta alternative
- Shredded into batters for breads, muffins, or fritters
- Added to soups, stews, and curries for extra texture
- Stuffed and baked with savory fillings

## Substitutions

Yellow squash or pattypan squash can be used in place of zucchini in most recipes. For raw preparations, cucumber offers a similar crunch, though with a different flavor.

## Storage

Store zucchini unwashed in the refrigerator crisper drawer, ideally in a perforated bag. Use within 4–5 days for best texture and flavor.
