## Description

Kosher salt is a coarse-grained salt named for its use in the koshering process of meats. It is less dense than table salt and dissolves easily, making it a favorite among chefs for seasoning and curing. Kosher salt has a clean, pure salty flavor without additives.

## How to use

- For seasoning meats, vegetables, and grains
- In brines and pickling solutions
- As a finishing salt
- For koshering meat (drawing out blood)

## Substitutions

If kosher salt is unavailable, substitute with [[sea salt]] or table salt, but adjust quantities as table salt is denser and saltier by volume.

## Storage

Store kosher salt in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping.
