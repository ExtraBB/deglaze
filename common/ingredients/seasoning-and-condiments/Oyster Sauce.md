## Description

Oyster sauce is a thick, dark, and savory sauce made from oyster extracts, sugar, salt, and sometimes soy sauce. It is widely used in East Asian cuisines, including Korean-Chinese dishes, to add umami, sweetness, and a glossy finish to stir-fries and sauces.

## How to use

- In stir-fries with vegetables, meats, or seafood
- As a base for sauces and glazes
- Added to marinades for depth and umami
- Drizzled over steamed greens

## Substitutions

If oyster sauce is unavailable, a mixture of soy sauce and a little [[sugar]] can be used, or vegetarian mushroom-based oyster sauce for a plant-based option.

## Storage

Store oyster sauce in the refrigerator after opening. It will keep for several months due to its high salt and sugar content.
