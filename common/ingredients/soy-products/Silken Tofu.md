# Silken Tofu

**Korean:** 연두부 (Yeon-dubu)

---

## Description
Silken tofu is a soft, custard-like tofu made from coagulated soy milk with minimal pressing. It has a delicate, smooth texture and high water content, making it ideal for soups, stews, and cold dishes.

## Common Uses
- Soft tofu stew
- Cold tofu dishes (e.g., chilled silken tofu with soy sauce)
- Added to soups for a silky texture
- Used in desserts or smoothies

## Substitutions
- Firm tofu (for firmer texture, but not as creamy)
- Egg tofu (for a similar soft texture)

## Storage
Keep refrigerated and submerged in water. Use within a few days of opening. Handle gently to avoid breaking. Not recommended for freezing as texture will degrade.
