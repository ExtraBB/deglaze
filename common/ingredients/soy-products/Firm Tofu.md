# Firm Tofu

**Korean:** 단단한 두부 (Dandanhan Dubu)

---

## Description
Firm tofu is a dense, pressed form of tofu made from coagulated soy milk. It holds its shape well and is commonly used in Korean cuisine for stir-fries, stews, grilling, and pan-frying. Its texture is chewy and it absorbs flavors from sauces and broths.

## Common Uses
- Stir-fried dishes (e.g., Dubu-bokkeum)
- Stews and soups (e.g., Kimchi-jjigae, Sundubu-jjigae)
- Grilled or pan-fried as a side dish
- Added to salads or braised dishes

## Substitutions
- Silken tofu (for softer texture, but not suitable for grilling or stir-frying)
- Extra-firm tofu (for even denser texture)

## Storage
Keep refrigerated and submerged in water. Change the water daily if not used immediately. Use within a week of opening. Can be frozen for longer storage, but texture will become spongier.
